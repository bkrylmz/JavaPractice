        ### Use a `loop` to print the alphabet from `A` to `Z`.
        Print all the characters in one line, with no spaces between them.

### Also use another `loop` to print the alphabet from `z` to `a`.
Print all the character in one line, with no spaces between them.

#### Note: There will be two lines in the output.
One of the uppercase letters from `A` to `Z`, and
a second line for the lowercase letter from `z` to `a`.

#### Note: Do not just print the the characters as a String,
use a loop to iterate through all the characters
